DRAGON COLLECTION TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST
============================================

If dragons are not disappearing on tap, check the following:

1. SCENE SETUP
   ☐ ScoreManager exists in scene (with TextMeshPro UI for score display)
   ☐ Canvas exists with EventSystem component
   ☐ Main Camera is tagged as "MainCamera"
   ☐ Dragons are spawned in the scene (check Logs for spawn messages)

2. DRAGON PREFAB SETUP
   ☐ Dragon prefab has "Collectible" script component
   ☐ Dragon prefab has SphereCollider component (not disabled)
   ☐ Collider is set to: IsTrigger = false
   ☐ Collider Radius = 5
   ☐ monsterName field is set (e.g., "Dragon Nightmare")

3. PHYSICS LAYER SETUP
   ☐ Dragons are on Default layer (or correct physics layer)
   ☐ Camera has correct culling mask
   ☐ No layer collision matrix issues preventing raycast

4. SCRIPT DEBUGGING
   ☐ Open Console (Window > TextMeshPro)
   ☐ Tap/Click a dragon
   ☐ Look for log messages:
      - "[Collectible] Initialized: ..." - Dragon script is ready
      - "[Collectible] ✓ TOUCHED: ..." - Touch was detected
      - "[Collectible] 🎉 COLLECTED: ..." - Collection successful

5. INPUT DEBUGGING
   ☐ Add InputDebugger script to any GameObject in scene
   ☐ Tap/Click anywhere on screen
   ☐ Check Console for raycast hit information
   ☐ Verify dragon colliders are being hit

6. UI BLOCKING CHECK
   ☐ Make sure Canvas is not blocking input
   ☐ Canvas RaycastTarget should be FALSE for non-interactive elements
   ☐ Test in a scene without UI overlay

7. COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

   Problem: "No main camera found!" error
   Fix: Ensure main camera is tagged as "MainCamera"

   Problem: Raycast hits nothing
   Fix: 
   - Check collider is not disabled
   - Check collider radius (5 is usually good)
   - Verify dragon is visible in game view
   - Check layer collision matrix

   Problem: Raycast hits but doesn't collect
   Fix:
   - Verify ScoreManager instance exists
   - Check Collectible script is not missing
   - Check monsterName is not empty

   Problem: Dragon disappears but score doesn't update
   Fix:
   - Verify ScoreManager.instance is not null
   - Check TextMeshProUGUI component is assigned
   - Verify scoreText reference in inspector

CONSOLE LOGS TO WATCH FOR:

✓ Successful Collection:
   [Collectible] Initialized: Dragon Nightmare on Blue
   [Collectible] ✓ TOUCHED: Blue (Dragon Nightmare)
   [Collectible] 🎉 COLLECTED: Dragon Nightmare! Score: 1

✗ Problems:
   [Collectible] No main camera found! - No MainCamera in scene
   [Collectible] ScoreManager instance not found! - ScoreManager missing
   [InputDebugger] Raycast hit 0 objects - Colliders not being detected

TESTING STEPS:

1. Open scene with dragons spawned
2. Open Console window
3. Tap/Click on visible dragon
4. Check Console for debug messages
5. Verify dragon disappears and score increments
